# Mobs

**Mobs**—short for [**mobiles**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mob_(video_games))—consists of peaceful or hostile creatures that roam the world.

They generally appear randomly in the game world depending on lighting, height and spawning [node](/for-players/nodes) conditions. Some of them may drop more or less precious [items](/for-players/items) when killed. Mobs are created by [mods](/for-players/mods) only, so their exact behavior depends on the mod or game you use. Technically, mobs are [objects](/for-engine-devs/objects).
