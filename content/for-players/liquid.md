# Liquid

**Liquids** are special dynamic [nodes](/for-players/nodes) in Luanti. They behave quite differently than in real life. Liquids like to spread and flow to their surrounding blocks and players can swim and drown in them.

Liquid forms
------------

Liquids usually come in two forms: In source form and in flowing form.

### Liquid source

Liquid sources have the shape of a full cube. A liquid source will generate flowing liquids around it from time to time, and, if the liquid is renewable, it also generates liquid sources (see below). A liquid source can sustain itself. If no special event happens, a liquid source will keep its place forever and it will never drain out.

### Flowing liquid

Flowing liquids take a “sloped” form and never the shape of a cube. Flowing liquids spread around the map until they drain. A flowing liquid can not sustain itself and always comes from a liquid source, either directly or indirectly. Without a liquid source, a flowing liquid will eventually drain out and disappear.

Liquid properties
-----------------

A liquid with a flowing range of 2, viewed from above

All liquids share the following properties:

*   _All properties of nodes_
*   Renewability: Renewable liquids can create new sources (see below)
*   Flowing range: How many flowing liquids are created at maximum per liquid source, it determines how far the liquid will “spread”. This is a number ranging from 0 to 8. If 0, no flowing liquids are generated at all. Usually, liquids have a flowing range of 8
*   Viscosity: How slow [players](/for-players/player) move through it and how fast new flowing liquids are created (i.e. how fast the liquid spreads)
*   Drowning damage: If set, it will a) reduce your [breath](/for-players/player#breath) (“bubbles”) while you are inside and b) will cause this amount of damage to you every 2 seconds if you ran out of breath while inside

Behaviour
---------

### Creation of liquid sources

Renewable liquid sources create new liquid sources at open spaces. A new liquid source is created when:

*   Two renewable liquid nodes of the same type touch each other diagonally
*   These nodes are also on the same height
*   One of the two “corners” is open space which allows liquids to flow in

When those criteria are met, the open space is filled with a new liquid source of the same type:

2 liquid sources (S) touch each other diagonally, but are separated by solid nodes.

The solid block at the top “corner” has been removed and a completely new liquid source block fills the empty space shortly after.

For comparison, a non-renewable liquid just flows (F) instead.
    

Interaction with liquids
------------------------

### Swimming and diving

Swimming in a liquid is fairly straightforward: The usual direction keys for basic movement, the jump key for rising and the sneak key for sinking. Note that the controls are different if the [pitch move mode](/for-players/controls#pitch-move-mode) is enabled.

The physics for swimming and diving in a liquid are, in detail:

*   Your movement speed in a liquid is determined by its viscosity
*   If you don't do anything in a liquid, you will slowly sink
*   There is no fall damage for falling into a liquid
*   If you fall from a great height into a liquid, you will be slowed down on impact (but you don't come instantly to a halt). Depending on your speed, you might end up deep in the liquid. The slow-down effect is much stronger for liquids with a high viscosity. For a safe high drop into a liquid, you need to make sure there is enough liquid above the ground, otherwise you might still suffer fall damage by hitting the ground.
*   Liquids may cause breath loss and drowning damage (see above)

### Pointing to liquids

Liquids are usually not [pointable](/for-players/pointing). However, all liquids can be pointed by special items. In [Minetest Game](https://content.luanti.org/packages/Minetest/minetest_game/), one example is the bucket.
