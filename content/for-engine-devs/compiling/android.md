# Compiling Luanti for Android

The instructions in this article were written for and tested on Linux,
but the tools used here should also work on other platforms.

## Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with the command line.
- You have a working network connection.
- You have already downloaded / cloned a copy of Luanti to a folder called `luanti`.
- You have an Android device you want to install Luanti on for testing purposes
  or you want to produce a Luanti release build for distribution.

## CLI tools

### Setup

You should have a recent version of OpenJDK installed (17 should be enough).

Download the command line tools from the [corresponding section on the Android Studio downloads page](https://developer.android.com/studio#command-line-tools-only).
Then extract it into an empty folder with the structure being as seen below.
The `android-sdk` folder will then become your SDK folder.

```
- android-sdk/
    - cmdline-tools/
```

Then open a terminal in `android-sdk/` and run the following command to accept the licenses for the SDK.
Accept the licenses that you definitively should read carefully.

```sh
./cmdline-tools/bin/sdkmanager --licenses --sdk_root=.
```

Now create a file called `local.properties` and configure the path to the Android SDK there:

```sh
cd luanti/android
echo 'sdk.dir=/home/<YOUR USER>/android-sdk' >local.properties
```

_(On Windows, if the above doesn't work, try running the command `sdkmanager --sdk_root="<path to the folder you want to install SDK tools to>" "platform-tools"`. You will likely need to add this path to your [PATH environment variable](https://www.howtogeek.com/118594/how-to-edit-your-system-path-for-easy-command-line-access/), so PowerShell can recognize the installed components.)_

### Building

Optional: First figure out the ABI of the device you wish to build for
and disable all other ABIs to significantly reduce build times.
(See [here](/improving-build-times/#android-disabling-unused-abis) for details.)

Luanti uses a [Gradle Wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html),
which makes building Luanti for Android very easy: You just run

```sh
cd luanti/android
./gradlew app:assembleDebug
```

_(If you're compiling on Windows, you can use the `gradle` command, so long as you install the additional Unix dependency [gettext](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/). Both of these are verified to work when installed by [Scoop](https://scoop.sh).)_

This will produce a number of debug builds in the form of `.apk` files (depending on the enabled ABIs)
in `android/app/build/outputs`:

```sh
$ find -name '*.apk'
./app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-armeabi-v7a-debug.apk
./app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-x86_64-debug.apk
./app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-x86-debug.apk
./app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-arm64-v8a-debug.apk
```

If you want to build a release, you would invoke `./gradlew app:assembleRelease` instead.
To sign the release APK before distribution, you should use [`apksigner`](https://developer.android.com/tools/apksigner).
(Debug APKs will already be signed automatically with a debug key.)

### Installing

If instead of building APKs you want to directly build and install the appropriate APK on your phone via the
Android Debug Bridge (ADB) [^1], you can run `./gradlew app:installDebug`,
or `./gradlew app:installRelease` if you want to install a release build
(e.g. for performance testing) instead.

## Using Android Studio

First, install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio),
for example by downloading an official release, unpacking it and then running `./android-studio/bin/studio.sh`.

Then, open `luanti/android` (_not_ the `luanti` folder):

![The Android Studio file picker, used to select `luanti/android`](/images/developing_for_android/open_folder.png)

It will load for a while. Be patient.

If you just want to quickly install and run a debug build on your phone,
you can simply click the "run" button in the top bar,
which will build Luanti for the correct ABI and install it afterwards via ADB [^1]:

![Android Studio "Run" Button](/images/developing_for_android/run.png)

Otherwise, click "Build" > "Generate Signed Bundle / APK" [^2]:

![Android Studio menu](/images/developing_for_android/generate_bundle.png)

Android Studio will now ask you to choose between a Bundle (for uploading to app stores) and an APK (for direct distribution & deployment).
We want to create an APK:

![Android Studio prompting the user to choose between a Bundle or APK](/images/developing_for_android/choose_bundle_format.png)

Now we have to sign it. Android Studio guides you through this process.
You first have to create a key store if you don't already have one.

Choose a key store path (you should probably keep this in a safe location),
then choose and confirm a key store password.

You also have to choose and confirm an (ideally separate) password for the individual key
(called `example_key` here).

Key creation asks for personal information.
Fill it out responsibly with as much information as you are comfortable providing.
You can not leave it entirely blank.

![Android Studio with a chosen key store path of `/home/lars/Android/Keystore.jks`](/images/developing_for_android/create_keystore.png)

Now proceed: Click "OK" and then "Next".

Android Studio will ask you to choose between a "debug" and a "release" build.
Since you're already going through the hassle of signing, we assume you want a release build.

Finally, you can just click "Create" and patiently wait for the release build to finish. This can take a while.

Once it has finished, Android Studio then lets you "locate" the APK,
which should be in `build/outputs/apk/release`
(or `build/outputs/apk/debug` for a debug build) relative to `luanti/android`.

If the build fails, you may try "Build" > "Clean Build" > "Clean Project" followed by "Build" > "Rebuild Project".

[^1]:
    This assumes your phone is connected and has USB debugging enabled (or you have set up an Android emulator).
    For details see the [ADB](https://developer.android.com/tools/adb) and Android Studio documentation.

[^2]:
    If you can't find the "Build" option in the top bar,
    you have to first click the hamburger in the top left corner.
    Such is the downfall of modern UI design.
