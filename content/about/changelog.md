## 5.11.0 → 5.12.0

Released on 23 May 2025.

### Deprecations and compatibility notes
- 5.12.0 is the first build to use SDL2 for window and input handling
  - Key bindings are now based on scancodes (i.e. key positions) instead of keycodes ("marking on the keycap"). After updating Luanti, the user will be prompted to verify and/or reassign their key bindings. See also: [Controls](/for-players/controls)
- Saved worlds that were newly created (or migrated using `luanti(server) (--server) --migrate ... --world ...`) by 5.12.0 can no longer be loaded by older versions. Worlds that are played over the network are unaffected.
  - Details: instead of a unified `pos` field for `x`, `y` and `z`, the coordinates are now saved individually. This makes the database more accessible by external tools. ([even more details](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/15768))
- Lua API: The node/item registration functions now use stricter checks to avoid bad practices in mods.
- Lua API: "Perlin noise" (and related functions) were renamed to "Fractal value noise". The old API remains accessible, yet without any deprecation warnings.
  - The old name was inappropriate: Luanti has always implemented value noise, *not* perlin noise.
- Lua API: The tool capabilities of the optional `"hand"` inventory slot now entirely overwrite the default hand. For clients < 5.12.0, default groupcaps were not overwritten by the `"hand"` slot.
- Remote media: The client will now use GET requests to allow static media hosting. ([details, writeup](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/15885#issuecomment-2708510220))

### Client / Audiovisuals
- Fix some models not rendering correctly as nodes (_appgurueu_)
- Android: Fixed a bug where fonts could turn black when leaving a world while the app is running in the background (_grorp_)

- IPv6 is now enabled by default (_sfan5_)
- More accurate collision code (_kno10_)
- `load_mod_* = false` lines are no longer written to `world.mt` (_appgurueu_)

### Script API / Modding
- glTF models: Local transforms no longer affect a skinned mesh. This bug used to cause wrong rendering. (_appgurueu_)
  - Tip: To avoid the bug on older Luanti client versions, simply remove the offending local transforms.
  - You can use [glTF validator](https://github.khronos.org/glTF-Validator/) to check whether your models are affected. The `NODE_SKINNED_MESH_LOCAL_TRANSFORMS` warning should not appear.
- Fix `visual_scale` not applying to skeletally animated meshes when used for nodes (_appgurueu_)
- New formspec element `allow_close[<bool>]` to prevent formspecs from closing (_v-rob_)
  - This only works for clients >= 5.12.0

- Fixed LBMs sometimes not being executed on newly generated mapblocks (_sfan5_)
- New function `table.copy_with_metatables` (_appgurueu_)
- `core.item_drop` now returns the spawned `obj` (_SmallJoker_)
- New `visual = "node"` option for entities to make it look like a regular node. (_sfan5_)
  - Clients prior to 5.12.0-dev cannot see this entity.
  - The builtin falling node entity was converted too.

- Various code cleanups and corrections (_appgurueu_, _sfan5_, _cx385_)

## 5.10.0 → 5.11.0

Released on 14th February 2025.

### Deprecations and compatibility notes

- Clients >= 5.11.0 will no longer support BMP texture files. This deprecation was first announced in 5.8.0.
- Basic shaders support is now mandatory. New minimum required OpenGL version: 2.0.
  - See [https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/issues/15370](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/issues/15370) for details.
- A bug related to skeletal animation has been fixed. The bug occurs when bones have "perfect" 180° rotations, equivalent to negatively scaling two axes.
  If these bones are then animated via bone overrides, the overridden rotation will incorrectly appear to be relative to the 180° rotation.
  This may result in wrong bone rotations for mods that rely on this bug. These mods need to fix the rotations passed to `set_bone_override` / the deprecated `set_bone_position`.
  Multiple workarounds are possible to ensure consistency with older Luanti clients which exhibit the bug,
  such as editing models to not have perfect rotations, overriding bone scale to force newer clients to replicate the bug,
  or overriding bone scale to work around the bug on older clients which support setting scale.
  See [the issue](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/issues/15692) for details.

## 5.3.0 → 5.4.0

Released on 23 Feb 2021.

### Deprecations and compatibility notes

- Removed support for bumpmapping, generated normal maps, and parallax occlusion (_Lars_, _hecks_)
  - These features had fundamental issues, several bugs, and were broken on some platforms.
- Deprecated node field value: `use_texture_alpha = true/false`
  - Fix: Use `clip`, `blend` or `opaque` (see documentation)
- Deprecated `get_player_velocity` and `add_player_velocity` (_rubenwardy_)
  - Fix: replace with `get_velocity()` and `add_velocity()`
- Deprecated multiply and divide with two vectors (Schur product and quotient) (_DS_)
  - Fix: implement your own version
- By default, the crosshair will now change to an "X" when pointing to objects. If your game had a custom crosshair, this might come as a surprise and break graphical consistency.
  - Fix: Specify object_crosshair.png image
- Added deprecation warning for node field: `alpha` (only limited compatibility provided)
  - This was already deprecated and undocumented.
  - Fix: Replace by `use_texture_alpha`
- Fixed deprecation warning when certain ores types ("sheet", "puff", "blob" and "vein") are missing `noise_params` (_rubenwardy_)
  - These ore types require noise_params. To keep the same behavior, you can use the following values:

```
noise_params = {
    offset  = 0,
    scale   = 1,
    spread  = {x=250, y=250, z=250},
    seed    = 12345,
    octaves = 3,
    persist = 0.6,
    lacunarity = 2,
    flags = "defaults",
}

```

## 5.0.0 → 5.0.1

5.0.1 was released on March 31, 2019.

- Fix detached inventory serialisation (_rubenwardy_)
- Fix texture rotation for wallmounted nodeboxes (_sfan5_)
- Fix build failing on some compilers (_rubenwardy_)

## 0.4.16 → 5.0.0

Released March 4th

Note: 5.0.0 is based on 0.4.16, not 0.4.17. 0.4.17 was created by backporting changes from the development branch of 5.0.0

### Highlights

- Add online content repository (games, mods, modpacks, texture packs)
- Add Carpathian mapgen
- Automatic jumping
- Android: Rewritten controls. Add joystick and modify up on-screen buttons
- Mods and games can be translated
- Rename 'subgame' to 'game'
- Modding: More node drawtypes: disconnected nodeboxes (more ways to create connected blocks), `plantlike_rooted` (for underwater plants)
- Modding: Custom player collision box
- Modding: A great deal of new map generator features
- Modding: Allow to rotate entities in all 3 axes

### New Version Scheme

Basically, the leading 0 has been dropped. The [version scheme](/for-engine-devs/version-number) was thus changed from

```
ZERO.MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

```

(note: PATCH was left out when it was 0) to

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

```

.

This was chosen for a few reasons:

- Shows that we aim to keep inter-version compatibility (which has mostly been the case since early 0.4.x)
- Allows us to release patch/bug fix only releases without adding a silly 4th number
- Doesn't imply that this version is the first stable/finished version as much as a 1.0.0 does.

For some context, read [the issue that resulted in this change](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/issues/6073).

### Breaking changes and deprecations

As a major release, 5.0.0 will break some mods written for 0.4.x versions. We tried to keep the breakages as small as possible whilst fixing long standing issues.

- Minetest now uses C++11 instead of C++03, make sure you have a compatible system (Windows Vista, Debian 8, Ubuntu 16.04, CentOS 7, macOS 10.7, …)
- Breaks network compatibility with 0.4.x. 0.4.x clients won't be able to connect to 5.x servers and vice-versa. Fix: update clients and servers to 5.x
- Attachment and player positions have been shifted by 1 node, to allow support for custom player selection boxes. Fix: update default and player_api, subtract `10` from any attachment positions, shift the origin of player models to the feet
- Formspec theming using prepended strings. This may cause wrong backgrounds to appear on formspecs. Fix: see [https://forum.luanti.org/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=20646](https://forum.luanti.org/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=20646)
- depends.txt and description.txt have been deprecated. Fix: use _description_, _depends_, and _optional_depends_ in mod.conf, game.conf, or texture_pack.conf instead
- modpack.txt has been deprecated. Fix: rename to or add _modpack.conf_.
- Use of deprecated methods such as _object:setpos()_ is now warned about. Fix: [replace them with correct functions](https://forum.luanti.org/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=20403)
- _player:get/set_attribute()_ is now deprecated. Fix: use _player:get_meta()_ instead
- _nodeupdate()_ was removed. Fix: replace with _minetest.check_for_falling_.
- Clouds API: changed speed param from 'y' to 'z'
- Player inventory list "hand" must now be manually initialized by mods (using _set_size_)
- Some client-side scripting functions were removed (see below)

Note that a function being _deprecated_ means that it still exists, but it may give a warning when used and may be removed in future. Deprecations are necessary to improve the consistency and efficiency of our API

### Client Modding

- Introducing Client-Side modding (CSM for the initiated). You can now have local mods to read various client data and handle different client events. This new modding step is very secure, you don't have access to all standard Lua API, just a subset, to protect your computers. Mods should be installed in @user_path@/clientmods.
- You will also have access to Client side commands, starting with a dot.
- If you want to know more about CSM API, please look at [Client Side Modding documentation](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/blob/master/doc/client_lua_api.md)
- Added by nerzhul, red-001, bigfoot547, Dumbeldor and paly2.

### Server Modding

- Remove `core.cause_crash` Lua call (_nerzhul_)
- Add `on_flood` server Lua callback (_sofar_)
- Add clouds API (_bendeutsch_)
